# üç†  YAM Protocol  üç†
## The Protocol
YAM protocol is a cryptocurrency built on the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed to create a soft price peg (but could be valueless) against any reserve asset by leveraging an elastic monetary supply to reward holders and a protocol governed treasury.

The token inflates and deflates its monetary supply in order to stabilze its peg (called a rebase). It is innovative by adding a treasury building mechanism into the rebase.

In a sense, YAM = AMPL + COMP + YFI + MKR. Rebasing mechanism akin to Ampleforth. COMP style-governance. YFI distribution. Maker peg creation.

That said, there is no guarantees around the peg. It may trade at a fraction of the intended peg, or much higher. Its price is determined by the market, with some reflexive mechanisms to promote but not ensure the peg.

## The Token
The core YAM token uses yCRV as the reserve currency, which is roughly a $1 peg. Each inflating rebase, a portion of tokens is minted and used to build up the treasury. This treasury is then in complete ownership of $YAM holders via governance.


## Distribution
It is undergoing a fair distribution - no premine, no VCs, no founders' shares. It is designed to be decentralized and autonomous.

Distribution is accomplished by utilizing the same method that YFI popularized. You can stake ETH, YFI, or AMPL/ETH uniswap shares to earn YAMs.

## Governance
Governance is entirely dictated by YAM holders from the start. Upon deployment, ownership of all YAM protocol contracts was reliquished to the Governance contract or removed entirely.

# Development
### Building
This repo uses truffle. Ensure that you have truffle installed.

Then, to build the contracts run:
```
$ truffle compile
```



To run tests, run against a single test package, i.e.:
```
$ truffle migrate --network test
$ python scripts/clean.py
$ cd jsLib
$ jest rebase
$ jest token
```

This seems to be a limitation around ganache + jest


Given the nature of rebases interacting with Uniswap, it may be helpful to run a fork of mainnet in ganache. This also unlocks largest yCRV holders account for running tests.

Make sure to have the latest `ganache-cli` to ensure tests run correctly.

Or run:
```
$ sh startBlockchain.sh
```

```
$ ganache-cli --fork <eth_rpc_url> --networkId 1001 --gasPrice 0x1312D00 -e 100000000000000000000 --gasLimit 12500000  --mnemonic="concert load couple harbor equip island argue ramp clarify fence smart topic" --max-old-space-size=8192 -u 0x0eb4add4ba497357546da7f5d12d39587ca24606
```
